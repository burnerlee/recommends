# Introduction

Hi guys, my name is Aaryan Garg. I am currently pursuing Deep Learning as my field of interest here at IIT Roorkee, apart from Electronics, ofc. I am also a member of the [Data Science Group](https://dsgiitr.com), and the [Vision and Language Group](https://vlgiitr.github.io). You can ping me on Whatsapp or FB. I'll be happy to help.

## How did I end up doing DL?

When I came to college, I was a really confused fresher just like you, and was just overwhelmed with whatever was happening around me. Then came the Linux Party, where I went to get Linux installed on my PC. There, I met some seniors who were members of DSG, and who told me about Deep Learning and stuff. I was intrigued and started to learn Machine Learning and Data Science using really good advice from my seniors.

## My Roadmap

Whenever you hear the words "ML/DL", "Data Science", one name is bound to pop-up: **Andrew Ng**. Trust me on this, if you want to get started with Machine Learning, you should complete his **_CS-229 course on Machine Learning_**. The lecture videos are available on YouTube and they require a good grasp on **_Probability and Statistics_**. Remember, this is not the same course that is available on Coursera. Although the course on Coursera is much, much popular, I recommend going with the lecture videos on YouTube because they will give you a great understanding of the math behing Machine Learning. After that, if you want to delve deeper into the math, I recommend you to read **_ISLR_**. However, if you want to learn the coding part, you should go with **_Sebastian Raschka_**. Now, till this point, all the courses covered Machine Learning. Now, you can start Deep Learning before learning Machine Learning as well as after it, but I would recommend the latter as it gives you a better grasp of the concepts (imo). To start Deep Learning, I would strongly advise you to read the **_Neural Networks and Deep Learning book by Michael Nielson_**, and then completing the **_CS-231n_** and **_CS-224n_** courses offered by Stanford. They will give you a good grasp of concepts and help you build a strong foundation. However, if you want to get a good hold of the math behind Deep Learning, I suggest that you read the **_Deep Learning Book_** (yes, its the name of the book), although its a teensy little bit outdated, it is a really good book.
